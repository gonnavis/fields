Fields

### Experimenting with simulating fields.

After recently learning about WebGL from [this
guide](https://webglfundamentals.org), I got my own basic 3D rendering working,
logging my progress in [this repository](https://github.com/joeiddon/webgl).

To experiment a bit further with the graphics library, and with some of my
maths and physics, this repository contains some experiments with simulating
different types of fields.

- [A 2D Electric Potential Scalar Field, Visualised in 3D](https://joeiddon.github.io/fields/)

### Controls

In both simulations, your mouse is used to place charges - move and click.
In the 3D simulation, you can pan with right click and hold.
